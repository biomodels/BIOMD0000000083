# Model Notes


This is model is according to the paper_Toward a detailed computational model
for the mammalian circadian clock_

In this model interlocked negative and positive regulation of Per,Cry,Bmal
,REV-ERBalpha genes are all involved.The model is actually robust so the
initial conditions are unimportant.We gave every entity zero as initial
value,and start the graph at time=132h.

The simulation results in figure 8B can be reproduced by roadRunner online and
Copasi. We use a ceiling function to simulate the day-light cycle.
